TODO: Figure out how to use Wing via a JavaScript "import" statement instead of
HTML <script> tags. I'm pretty sure <script> tags won't work with webpack.

NOTE: I started adding Vue Router to this project, but it seems better to start over
with a a new project templated from Vue CLI. See the StaticTGC project for further
progress.

TODO: Bundle Bootstrap and single-file components using webpack instead of
including them via script and link tags. See https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/
to learn webpack and https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs/reference/starter-templates/
for examples of using it with bootstrap.

TODO: Display the cart contents using a Bootstrap-Vue table.
